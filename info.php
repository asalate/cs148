<h1>Why should I be on The Wall of Photos?</h1>

<p>Being very general, there are three kinds of students. Those who like to be involved, those who sometimes like to be involved and 
those who do not want to be involved. Whatever kind of student you are or were, you were a part of the UVM community. So even if you don't 
like to be involved it's always nice to have a picture of everyone. Months, years, or decades down the line you can always look
back at yourself and remember the past. The Wall is more than just a picture of a student, The Wall is a place to remember and keep 
track of students whether new or old.</p>

<h3>Who Made The Wall?</h3>

<h3>ME!</h3>
<p>My name is Anna Salate and I am a Statistics Graduate student here at UVM. I don't have much programming experience, but I do enjoy a 
challenge. What I've made here on this website is one of the most complex things I've programmed. In high school I programmed the game
Pong and in Matlab I programmed Minesweeper, and that about wraps it up for me.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to view this page. Have a lovely day =]</p>
